# Components Directory Structure

This directory organizes all React components by purpose and domain for scalability and clarity:

- **ui/**: Reusable, framework-agnostic UI primitives (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.)
- **layout/**: Layout components (headers, footers, navigation, wrappers)
- **shared/**: Shared components used across multiple domains or features
- **patient/**: Components specific to the patient user experience
- **doctor/**: Components specific to the doctor user experience
- **admin/**: Components specific to admin dashboards and management
- **cms/**: Components related to content management system (CMS) functionality

This structure supports modular, maintainable development as the project grows.
